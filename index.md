## Who are we? ##

We are aging researchers and longevity enthusiasts who are curious about their own personal genomics. 

### What is Just DNA-Seq? ###

First human genome sequencing happened two decades ago and cost around 3 bln $. Today it turned from a great human endeavor to something that is accessible to all of us, and costs roughly 400-800 dollars. 

So why bother with the DIY approach when there are a lot of personal genomics services out there already? 

For us, the main concerns are the lack of transparency, privacy and, most importantly, room for customization - content of reports is decided by service, your choice is limited with their product line. Results such services deliver are based on proprietary databases and algorithms. While having large analysis departments and a lot of medical data to base conclusions upon, their analysis is not transparent at all, in many cases you have no idea why they made this or that prediction. Verifying or comparing their results is therefore troublesome, especially when you get totally different predictions from many companies. 
More to that, what if we want to see how well our genes align with the prospect of longevity? For example, it is known that surviving until 90 years is more about lifestyle choices while living longer depends more on the genetics, [people with exceptional longevity are not distinct in terms of lifestyle factors from the general population](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2011.03498.x). Unfortunately, there are simply no commercial offerings to address that demand. 

At the same time, all the information necessary to do your own analysis is out there, lying in the open generously shared by the scientific community. So, why not use existing open source solutions developed by large academic groups then? Well, no luck here either! We looked through the existing ones and found out there are no tools to cover one topic very close to our hearts: genetics of longevity. That’s when DNA-Seq comes into play - we decided to take existing data from longevity gene variants databases and write a longevity annotations plugin for OpenCravat (Open Custom Ranked Analysis of Variants Toolkit) that we are using for genetic variant annotations


## Why a Gitcoin Grant? ##

This Gitcoin grant will be used to fund and speed up the development of the project. This project is made by enthusiasts, which means devoting one's spare time on top of a dayjob to do more work. The downside is, of course, slow progress. We’re hoping to provide a financial incentive for freelance coders and scientists to invest their time, because we believe having a free longevity annotation tool will help everyone in the end:
With sequencing costs dropping further and further, more and more people will be willing to look into their genes. We want them to have a tool to assess the prospect of longevity as early as possible.



## Why should you contribute? ##

Sequencing your genome is basically a one time endeavor, it is not going to change over time, raw information can be reused, rectified and combined with new data afterwards. Analysis, on the other hand, gets old basically the moment you’re reading your report. Thousands articles come out every year, understanding the roles, risks, and benefits of each and every SNP changes and improves along.  We plan to make a report tool capable of comparing existing scientific knowledge on longevity against your genetic data. This will enable you to know what to expect of your late life years, how close are your genes to the ones centenarians have.

## Other ways to help us ##

- If you have programming skills you can help with development
- If you have biological skills you can help with prioritizing genes in genetic reports and literature curation
- If you are analyzing your data you can always provide feedback of what should be improved
